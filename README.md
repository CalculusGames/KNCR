> Kotlin/Native CInterop Repository

## Why?

Kotlin/Native CInterop allows you to integrate C projects into your Kotlin/Native projects, assuming you either have a header-only library or
have the binaries available at your disposal. This projects solves these issues by providing a way to generate the Klib for you, so you can use it in your Kotlin/Native projects.
